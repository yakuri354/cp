chapter i there were four of us george and william samuel harris and myself and montmorency we were sitting in my room smoking and talking about how bad we were bad from a medical point of view i mean of course we were all feeling seedy and we were getting quite nervous about it harris said he felt such extraordinary fits of giddiness come over him at times that he hardly knew what he was doing and then george said that he had fits of giddiness too and hardly knew what he was doing with me it was my liver that was out of order i knew it was my liver that was out of order because i had just been reading a patent liver pill circular in which were detailed the various symptoms by which a man could tell when his liver was out of order i had them all it is a most extraordinary thing but i never read a patent medicine advertisement without being impelled to the conclusion that i am suffering from the particular disease therein dealt with in its most virulent form the diagnosis seems in every case to correspond exactly with all the sensations that i have ever felt man reading booki remember going to the british museum one day to read up the treatment for some slight ailment of which i had a touch hay fever i fancy it was i got down the book and read all i came to read and then in an unthinking moment i idly turned the leaves and began to indolently study diseases generally i forget which was the first distemper i plunged into some fearful devastating scourge i know and before i had glanced half down the list of premonitory symptoms it was borne in upon me that i had fairly got it i sat for awhile frozen with horror and then in the listlessness of despair i again turned over the pages i came to typhoid fever read the symptoms discovered that i had typhoid fever must have had it for months without knowing it wondered what else i had got turned up st vitus s dance found as i expected that i had that too began to get interested in my case and determined to sift it to the bottom and so started alphabetically read up ague and learnt that i was sickening for it and that the acute stage would commence in about another fortnight bright s disease i was relieved to find i had only in a modified form and so far as that was concerned i might live for years cholera i had with severe complications and diphtheria i seemed to have been born with i plodded conscientiously through the twenty six letters and the only malady i could conclude i had not got was housemaid s knee i felt rather hurt about this at first it seemed somehow to be a sort of slight why hadn t i got housemaid s knee why this invidious reservation after a while however less grasping feelings prevailed i reflected that i had every other known malady in the pharmacology and i grew less selfish and determined to do without housemaid s knee gout in its most malignant stage it would appear had seized me without my being aware of it and zymosis i had evidently been suffering with from boyhood there were no more diseases after zymosis so i concluded there was nothing else the matter with me i sat and pondered i thought what an interesting case i must be from a medical point of view what an acquisition i should be to a class students would have no need to walk the hospitals if they had me i was a hospital in myself all they need do would be to walk round me and after that take their diploma then i wondered how long i had to live i tried to examine myself i felt my pulse i could not at first feel any pulse at all then all of a sudden it seemed to start off i pulled out my watch and timed it i made it a hundred and forty seven to the minute i tried to feel my heart i could not feel my heart it had stopped beating i have since been induced to come to the opinion that it must have been there all the time and must have been beating but i cannot account for it i patted myself all over my front from what i call my waist up to my head and i went a bit round each side and a little way up the back but i could not feel or hear anything i tried to look at my tongue i stuck it out as far as ever it would go and i shut one eye and tried to examine it with the other i could only see the tip and the only thing that i could gain from that was to feel more certain than before that i had scarlet fever man with walking sticki had walked into that reading room a happy healthy man i crawled out a decrepit wreck i went to my medical man he is an old chum of mine and feels my pulse and looks at my tongue and talks about the weather all for nothing when i fancy i m ill so i thought i would do him a good turn by going to him now what a doctor wants i said is practice he shall have me he will get more practice out of me than out of seventeen hundred of your ordinary commonplace patients with only one or two diseases each so i went straight up and saw him and he said well what s the matter with you i said i will not take up your time dear boy with telling you what is the matter with me life is brief and you might pass away before i had finished but i will tell you what is not the matter with me i have not got housemaid s knee why i have not got housemaid s knee i cannot tell you but the fact remains that i have not got it everything else however i have got and i told him how i came to discover it all then he opened me and looked down me and clutched hold of my wrist and then he hit me over the chest when i wasn t expecting it a cowardly thing to do i call it and immediately afterwards butted me with the side of his head after that he sat down and wrote out a prescription and folded it up and gave it me and i put it in my pocket and went out i did not open it i took it to the nearest chemist s and handed it in the man read it and then handed it back he said he didn t keep it i said you are a chemist he said i am a chemist if i was a co operative stores and family hotel combined i might be able to oblige you being only a chemist hampers me i read the prescription it ran lb beefsteak with pt bitter beer every hours ten mile walk every morning bed at sharp every night and don t stuff up your head with things you don t understand i followed the directions with the happy result speaking for myself that my life was preserved and is still going on in the present instance going back to the liver pill circular i had the symptoms beyond all mistake the chief among them being a general disinclination to work of any kind what i suffer in that way no tongue can tell from my earliest infancy i have been a martyr to it as a boy the disease hardly ever left me for a day they did not know then that it was my liver medical science was in a far less advanced state than now and they used to put it down to laziness why you skulking little devil you they would say get up and do something for your living can t you not knowing of course that i was ill and they didn t give me pills they gave me clumps on the side of the head and strange as it may appear those clumps on the head often cured me for the time being i have known one clump on the head have more effect upon my liver and make me feel more anxious to go straight away then and there and do what was wanted to be done without further loss of time than a whole box of pills does now you know it often is so those simple old fashioned remedies are sometimes more efficacious than all the dispensary stuff we sat there for half an hour describing to each other our maladies i explained to george and william harris how i felt when i got up in the morning and william harris told us how he felt when he went to bed and george stood on the hearth rug and gave us a clever and powerful piece of acting illustrative of how he felt in the night george fancies he is ill but there s never anything really the matter with him you know at this point mrs poppets knocked at the door to know if we were ready for supper we smiled sadly at one another and said we supposed we had better try to swallow a bit harris said a little something in one s stomach often kept the disease in check and mrs poppets brought the tray in and we drew up to the table and toyed with a little steak and onions and some rhubarb tart i must have been very weak at the time because i know after the first half hour or so i seemed to take no interest whatever in my food an unusual thing for me and i didn t want any cheese this duty done we refilled our glasses lit our pipes and resumed the discussion upon our state of health what it was that was actually the matter with us we none of us could be sure of but the unanimous opinion was that it whatever it was had been brought on by overwork what we want is rest said harris rest and a complete change said george the overstrain upon our brains has produced a general depression throughout the system change of scene and absence of the necessity for thought will restore the mental equilibrium george has a cousin who is usually described in the charge sheet as a medical student so that he naturally has a somewhat family physicianary way of putting things i agreed with george and suggested that we should seek out some retired and old world spot far from the madding crowd and dream away a sunny week among its drowsy lanes some half forgotten nook hidden away by the fairies out of reach of the noisy world some quaint perched eyrie on the cliffs of time from whence the surging waves of the nineteenth century would sound far off and faint harris said he thought it would be humpy he said he knew the sort of place i meant where everybody went to bed at eight o clock and you couldn t get a referee for love or money and had to walk ten miles to get your baccy no said harris if you want rest and change you can t beat a sea trip i objected to the sea trip strongly a sea trip does you good when you are going to have a couple of months of it but for a week it is wicked you start on monday with the idea implanted in your bosom that you are going to enjoy yourself you wave an airy adieu to the

the

boys on shore light your biggest pipe and swagger about the deck as if you were captain cook sir francis drake and christopher columbus all rolled into one on tuesday you wish you hadn t come on wednesday thursday and friday you wish you were dead on saturday you are able to swallow a little beef tea and to sit up on deck and answer with a wan sweet smile when kind hearted people ask you how you feel now on sunday you begin to walk about again and take solid food and on monday morning as with your bag and umbrella in your hand you stand by the gunwale waiting to step ashore you begin to thoroughly like it i remember my brother in law going for a short sea trip once for the benefit of his health he took a return berth from london to liverpool and when he got to liverpool the only thing he was anxious about was to sell that return ticket it was offered round the town at a tremendous reduction so i am told and was eventually sold for eighteenpence to a bilious looking youth who had just been advised by his medical men to go to the sea side and take exercise sea side said my brother in law pressing the ticket affectionately into his hand why you ll have enough to last you a lifetime and as for exercise why you ll get more exercise sitting down on that ship than you would turning somersaults on dry land he himself my brother in law came back by train he said the north western railway was healthy enough for him another fellow i knew went for a week s voyage round the coast and before they started the steward came to him to ask whether he would pay for each meal as he had it or arrange beforehand for the whole series the steward recommended the latter course as it would come so much cheaper he said they would do him for the whole week at two pounds five he said for breakfast there would be fish followed by a grill lunch was at one and consisted of four courses dinner at six soup fish entree joint poultry salad sweets cheese and dessert and a light meat supper at ten my friend thought he would close on the two pound five job he is a hearty eater and did so lunch came just as they were off sheerness he didn t feel so hungry as he thought he should and so contented himself with a bit of boiled beef and some strawberries and cream he pondered a good deal during the afternoon and at one time it seemed to him that he had been eating nothing but boiled beef for weeks and at other times it seemed that he must have been living on strawberries and cream for years neither the beef nor the strawberries and cream seemed happy either seemed discontented like at six they came and told him dinner was ready the announcement aroused no enthusiasm within him but he felt that there was some of that two pound five to be worked off and he held on to ropes and things and went down a pleasant odour of onions and hot ham mingled with fried fish and greens greeted him at the bottom of the ladder and then the steward came up with an oily smile and said what can i get you sir man feeling ill get me out of this was the feeble reply and they ran him up quick and propped him up over to leeward and left him for the next four days he lived a simple and blameless life on thin captain s biscuits i mean that the biscuits were thin not the captain and soda water but towards saturday he got uppish and went in for weak tea and dry toast and on monday he was gorging himself on chicken broth he left the ship on tuesday and as it steamed away from the landing stage he gazed after it regretfully there she goes he said there she goes with two pounds worth of food on board that belongs to me and that i haven t had he said that if they had given him another day he thought he could have put it straight so i set my face against the sea trip not as i explained upon my own account i was never queer but i was afraid for george george said he should be all right and would rather like it but he would advise harris and me not to think of it as he felt sure we should both be ill harris said that to himself it was always a mystery how people managed to get sick at sea said he thought people must do it on purpose from affectation said he had often wished to be but had never been able then he told us anecdotes of how he had gone across the channel when it was so rough that the passengers had to be tied into their berths and he and the captain were the only two living souls on board who were not ill sometimes it was he and the second mate who were not ill but it was generally he and one other man if not he and another man then it was he by himself it is a curious fact but nobody ever is sea sick on land at sea you come across plenty of people very bad indeed whole boat loads of them but i never met a man yet on land who had ever known at all what it was to be sea sick where the thousands upon thousands of bad sailors that swarm in every ship hide themselves when they are on land is a mystery if most men were like a fellow i saw on the yarmouth boat one day i could account for the seeming enigma easily enough it was just off southend pier i recollect and he was leaning out through one of the port holes in a very dangerous position i went up to him to try and save him hi come further in i said shaking him by the shoulder you ll be overboard oh my i wish i was was the only answer i could get and there i had to leave him three weeks afterwards i met him in the coffee room of a bath hotel talking about his voyages and explaining with enthusiasm how he loved the sea good sailor he replied in answer to a mild young man s envious query well i did feel a little queer once i confess it was off cape horn the vessel was wrecked the next morning i said weren t you a little shaky by southend pier one day and wanted to be thrown overboard southend pier he replied with a puzzled expression yes going down to yarmouth last friday three weeks oh ah yes he answered brightening up i remember now i did have a headache that afternoon it was the pickles you know they were the most disgraceful pickles i ever tasted in a respectable boat did you have any for myself i have discovered an excellent preventive against sea sickness in balancing myself you stand in the centre of the deck and as the ship heaves and pitches you move your body about so as to keep it always straight when the front of the ship rises you lean forward till the deck almost touches your nose and when its back end gets up you lean backwards this is all very well for an hour or two but you can t balance yourself for a week george said let s go up the river he said we should have fresh air exercise and quiet the constant change of scene would occupy our minds including what there was of harris s and the hard work would give us a good appetite and make us sleep well harris said he didn t think george ought to do anything that would have a tendency to make him sleepier than he always was as it might be dangerous he said he didn t very well understand how george was going to sleep any more than he did now seeing that there were only twenty four hours in each day summer and winter alike but thought that if he did sleep any more he might just as well be dead and so save his board and lodging harris said however that the river would suit him to a t i don t know what a t is except a sixpenny one which includes bread and butter and cake ad lib and is cheap at the price if you haven t had any dinner it seems to suit everybody however which is greatly to its credit it suited me to a t too and harris and i both said it was a good idea of george s and we said it in a tone that seemed to somehow imply that we were surprised that george should have come out so sensible montmorencythe only one who was not struck with the suggestion was montmorency he never did care for the river did montmorency it s all very well for you fellows he says you like it but i don t there s nothing for me to do scenery is not in my line and i don t smoke if i see a rat you won t stop and if i go to sleep you get fooling about with the boat and slop me overboard if you ask me i call the whole thing bally foolishness we were three to one however and the motion was carried chapter ii plans discussed pleasures of camping out on fine nights ditto wet nights compromise decided on montmorency first impressions of fears lest he is too good for this world fears subsequently dismissed as groundless meeting adjourns we pulled out the maps and discussed plans we arranged to start on the following saturday from kingston harris and i would go down in the morning and take the boat up to chertsey and george who would not be able to get away from the city till the afternoon george goes to sleep at a bank from ten to four each day except saturdays when they wake him up and put him outside at two would meet us there should we camp out or sleep at inns george and i were for camping out we said it would be so wild and free so patriarchal like slowly the golden memory of the dead sun fades from the hearts of the cold sad clouds silent like sorrowing children the birds have ceased their song and only the moorhen s plaintive cry and the harsh croak of the corncrake stirs the awed hush around the couch of waters where the dying day breathes out her last from the dim woods on either bank night s ghostly army the grey shadows creep out with noiseless tread to chase away the lingering rear guard of the light and pass with noiseless unseen feet above the waving river grass and through the sighing rushes and night upon her sombre throne folds her black wings above the darkening world and from her phantom palace lit by the pale stars reigns in stillness river scene then we run our little boat into some quiet nook and the tent is pitched and the frugal supper cooked and eaten then the big pipes are filled and lighted and the pleasant chat goes round in musical undertone while in the pauses of our talk the river playing round the boat prattles strange old tales and secrets sings low the old child s

child s
1976
song that it has sung so many thousand years will sing so many thousand years to come before its voice grows harsh and old a song that we who have learnt to love its changing face who have so often nestled on its yielding bosom think somehow we understand though we could not tell you in mere words the story that we listen to and we sit there by its margin while the moon who loves it too stoops down to kiss it with a sister s kiss and throws her silver arms around it clingingly and we watch it as it flows ever singing ever whispering out to meet its king the sea till our voices die away in silence and the pipes go out till we common place everyday young men enough feel strangely full of thoughts half sad half sweet and do not care or want to speak till we laugh and rising knock the ashes from our burnt out pipes and say good night and lulled by the lapping water and the rustling trees we fall asleep beneath the great still stars and dream that the world is young again young and sweet as she used to be ere the centuries of fret and care had furrowed her fair face ere her children s sins and follies had made old her loving heart sweet as she was in those bygone days when a new made mother she nursed us her children upon her own deep breast ere the wiles of painted civilization had lured us away from her fond arms and the poisoned sneers of artificiality had made us ashamed of the simple life we led with her and the simple stately home where mankind was born so many thousands years ago harris said how about when it rained you can never rouse harris there is no poetry about harris no wild yearning for the unattainable harris never weeps he knows not why if harris s eyes fill with tears you can bet it is because harris has been eating raw onions or has put too much worcester over his chop mermaidif you were to stand at night by the sea shore with harris and say hark do you not hear is it but the mermaids singing deep below the waving waters or sad spirits chanting dirges for white corpses held by seaweed harris would take you by the arm and say i know what it is old man you ve got a chill now you come along with me i know a place round the corner here where you can get a drop of the finest scotch whisky you ever tasted put you right in less than no time harris always does know a place round the corner where you can get something brilliant in the drinking line i believe that if you met harris up in paradise supposing such a thing likely he would immediately greet you with so glad you ve come old fellow i ve found a nice place round the corner here where you can get some really first class nectar in the present instance however as regarded the camping out his practical view of the matter came as a very timely hint camping out in rainy weather is not pleasant it is evening you are wet through and there is a good two inches of water in the boat and all the things are damp you find a place on the banks that is not quite so puddly as other places you have seen and you land and lug out the tent and two of you proceed to fix it it is soaked and heavy and it flops about and tumbles down on you and clings round your head and makes you mad the rain is pouring steadily down all the time it is difficult enough to fix a tent in dry weather in wet the task becomes herculean instead of helping you it seems to you that the other man is simply playing the fool just as you get your side beautifully fixed he gives it a hoist from his end and spoils it all here what are you up to you call out what are you up to he retorts leggo can t you don t pull it you ve got it all wrong you stupid ass you shout no i haven t he yells back let go your side i tell you you ve got it all wrong you roar wishing that you could get at him and you give your ropes a lug that pulls all his pegs out ah the bally idiot you hear him mutter to himself and then comes a savage haul and away goes your side you lay down the mallet and start to go round and tell him what you think about the whole business and at the same time he starts round in the same direction to come and explain his views to you and you follow each other round and round swearing at one another until the tent tumbles down in a heap and leaves you looking at each other across its ruins when you both indignantly exclaim in the same breath there you are what did i tell you meanwhile the third man who has been baling out the boat and who has spilled the water down his sleeve and has been cursing away to himself steadily for the last ten minutes wants to know what the thundering blazes you re playing at and why the blarmed tent isn t up yet at last somehow or other it does get up and you land the things it is hopeless attempting to make a wood fire so you light the methylated spirit stove and crowd round that rainwater is the chief article of diet at supper the bread is two thirds rainwater the beefsteak pie is exceedingly rich in it and the jam and the butter and the salt and the coffee have all combined with it to make soup after supper you find your tobacco is damp and you cannot smoke luckily you have a bottle of the stuff that cheers and inebriates if taken in proper quantity and this restores to you sufficient interest in life to induce you to go to bed there you dream that an elephant has suddenly sat down on your chest and that the volcano has exploded and thrown you down to the bottom of the sea the elephant still sleeping peacefully on your bosom you wake up and grasp the idea that something terrible really has happened your first impression is that the end of the world has come and then you think that this cannot be and that it is thieves and murderers or else fire and this opinion you express in the usual method no help comes however and all you know is that thousands of people are kicking you and you are being smothered somebody else seems in trouble too you can hear his faint cries coming from underneath your bed determining at all events to sell your life dearly you struggle frantically hitting out right and left with arms and legs and yelling lustily the while and at last something gives way and you find your head in the fresh air two feet off you dimly observe a half dressed ruffian waiting to kill you and you are preparing for a life and death struggle with him when it begins to dawn upon you that it s jim oh it s you is it he says recognising you at the same moment yes you answer rubbing your eyes what s happened bally tent s blown down i think he says where s bill then you both raise up your voices and shout for bill and the ground beneath you heaves and rocks and the muffled voice that you heard before replies from out the ruin get off my head can t you and bill struggles out a muddy trampled wreck and in an unnecessarily aggressive mood he being under the evident belief that the whole thing has been done on purpose in the morning you are all three speechless owing to having caught severe colds in the night you also feel very quarrelsome and you swear at each other in hoarse whispers during the whole of breakfast time we therefore decided that we would sleep out on fine nights and hotel it and inn it and pub it like respectable folks when it was wet or when we felt inclined for a change montmorency hailed this compromise with much approval he does not revel in romantic solitude give him something noisy and if a trifle low so much the jollier to look at montmorency you would imagine that he was an angel sent upon the earth for some reason withheld from mankind in the shape of a small fox terrier there is a sort of oh what a wicked world this is and how i wish i could do something to make it better and nobler expression about montmorency that has been known to bring the tears into the eyes of pious old ladies and gentlemen when first he came to live at my expense i never thought i should be able to get him to stop long i used to sit down and look at him as he sat on the rug and looked up at me and think oh that dog will never live he will be snatched up to the bright skies in a chariot that is what will happen to him but when i had paid for about a dozen chickens that he had killed and had dragged him growling and kicking by the scruff of his neck out of a hundred and fourteen street fights and had had a dead cat brought round for my inspection by an irate female who called me a murderer and had been summoned by the man next door but one for having a ferocious dog at large that had kept him pinned up in his own tool shed afraid to venture his nose outside the door for over two hours on a cold night and had learned that the gardener unknown to myself had won thirty shillings by backing him to kill rats against time then i began to think that maybe they d let him remain on earth for a bit longer after all to hang about a stable and collect a gang of the most disreputable dogs to be found in the town and lead them out to march round the slums to fight other disreputable dogs is montmorency s idea of life and so as i before observed he gave to the suggestion of inns and pubs and hotels his most emphatic approbation having thus settled the sleeping arrangements to the satisfaction of all four of us the only thing left to discuss was what we should take with us and this we had begun to argue when harris said he d had enough oratory for one night and proposed that we should go out and have a smile saying that he had found a place round by the square where you could really get a drop of irish worth drinking whisky glassgeorge said he felt thirsty i never knew george when he didn t and as i had a presentiment that a little whisky warm with a slice of lemon would do my complaint good the debate was by common assent adjourned to the following night and the assembly put on its hats and went out chapter iii arrangements settled harris s method of doing work how the elderly family man puts up a picture george makes a sensible remark delights of early morning bathing provisions for getting

upset so on the following evening we again assembled to discuss and arrange our plans harris said now the first thing to settle is what to take with us now you get a bit of paper and write down j and you get the grocery catalogue george and somebody give me a bit of pencil and then i ll make out a list that s harris all over so ready to take the burden of everything himself and put it on the backs of other people he always reminds me of my poor uncle podger you never saw such a commotion up and down a house in all your life as when my uncle podger undertook to do a job a picture would have come home from the frame maker s and be standing in the dining room waiting to be put up and aunt podger would ask what was to be done with it and uncle podger would say oh you leave that to me don t you any of you worry yourselves about that i ll do all that and then he would take off his coat and begin he would send the girl out for sixpen orth of nails and then one of the boys after her to tell her what size to get and from that he would gradually work down and start the whole house candle now you go and get me my hammer will he would shout and you bring me the rule tom and i shall want the step ladder and i had better have a kitchen chair too and jim you run round to mr goggles and tell him pa s kind regards and hopes his leg s better and will he lend him his spirit level and don t you go maria because i shall want somebody to hold me the light and when the girl comes back she must go out again for a bit of picture cord and tom where s tom tom you come here i shall want you to hand me up the picture and then he would lift up the picture and drop it and it would come out of the frame and he would try to save the glass and cut himself and then he would spring round the room looking for his handkerchief he could not find his handkerchief because it was in the pocket of the coat he had taken off and he did not know where he had put the coat and all the house had to leave off looking for his tools and start looking for his coat while he would dance round and hinder them nails etc doesn t anybody in the whole house know where my coat is i never came across such a set in all my life upon my word i didn t six of you and you can t find a coat that i put down not five minutes ago well of all the then he d get up and find that he had been sitting on it and would call out oh you can give it up i ve found it myself now might just as well ask the cat to find anything as expect you people to find it and when half an hour had been spent in tying up his finger and a new glass had been got and the tools and the ladder and the chair and the candle had been brought he would have another go the whole family including the girl and the charwoman standing round in a semi circle ready to help two people would have to hold the chair and a third would help him up on it and hold him there and a fourth would hand him a nail and a fifth would pass him up the hammer and he would take hold of the nail and drop it there he would say in an injured tone now the nail s gone and we would all have to go down on our knees and grovel for it while he would stand on the chair and grunt and want to know if he was to be kept there all the evening the nail would be found at last but by that time he would have lost the hammer where s the hammer what did i do with the hammer great heavens seven of you gaping round there and you don t know what i did with the hammer we would find the hammer for him and then he would have lost sight of the mark he had made on the wall where the nail was to go in and each of us had to get up on the chair beside him and see if we could find it and we would each discover it in a different place and he would call us all fools one after another and tell us to get down and he would take the rule and re measure and find that he wanted half thirty one and three eighths inches from the corner and would try to do it in his head and go mad and we would all try to do it in our heads and all arrive at different results and sneer at one another and in the general row the original number would be forgotten and uncle podger would have to measure it again he would use a bit of string this time and at the critical moment when the old fool was leaning over the chair at an angle of forty five and trying to reach a point three inches beyond what was possible for him to reach the string would slip and down he would slide on to the piano a really fine musical effect being produced by the suddenness with which his head and body struck all the notes at the same time and aunt maria would say that she would not allow the children to stand round and hear such language at last uncle podger would get the spot fixed again and put the point of the nail on it with his left hand and take the hammer in his right hand and with the first blow he would smash his thumb and drop the hammer with a yell on somebody s toes aunt maria would mildly observe that next time uncle podger was going to hammer a nail into the wall she hoped he d let her know in time so that she could make arrangements to go and spend a week with her mother while it was being done oh you women you make such a fuss over everything uncle podger would reply picking himself up why i like doing a little job of this sort uncle podger admiring his work and then he would have another try and at the second blow the nail would go clean through the plaster and half the hammer after it and uncle podger be precipitated against the wall with force nearly sufficient to flatten his nose then we had to find the rule and the string again and a new hole was made and about midnight the picture would be up very crooked and insecure the wall for yards round looking as if it had been smoothed down with a rake and everybody dead beat and wretched except uncle podger there you are he would say stepping heavily off the chair on to the charwoman s corns and surveying the mess he had made with evident pride why some people would have had a man in to do a little thing like that harris will be just that sort of man when he grows up i know and i told him so i said i could not permit him to take so much labour upon himself i said no you get the paper and the pencil and the catalogue and george write down and i ll do the work the first list we made out had to be discarded it was clear that the upper reaches of the thames would not allow of the navigation of a boat sufficiently large to take the things we had set down as indispensable so we tore the list up and looked at one another george said you know we are on a wrong track altogether we must not think of the things we could do with but only of the things that we can t do without george comes out really quite sensible at times you d be surprised i call that downright wisdom not merely as regards the present case but with reference to our trip up the river of life generally how many people on that voyage load up the boat till it is ever in danger of swamping with a store of foolish things which they think essential to the pleasure and comfort of the trip but which are really only useless lumber how they pile the poor little craft mast high with fine clothes and big houses with useless servants and a host of swell friends that do not care twopence for them and that they do not care three ha pence for with expensive entertainments that nobody enjoys with formalities and fashions with pretence and ostentation and with oh heaviest maddest lumber of all the dread of what will my neighbour think with luxuries that only cloy with pleasures that bore with empty show that like the criminal s iron crown of yore makes to bleed and swoon the aching head that wears it it is lumber man all lumber throw it overboard it makes the boat so heavy to pull you nearly faint at the oars it makes it so cumbersome and dangerous to manage you never know a moment s freedom from anxiety and care never gain a moment s rest for dreamy laziness no time to watch the windy shadows skimming lightly o er the shallows or the glittering sunbeams flitting in and out among the ripples or the great trees by the margin looking down at their own image or the woods all green and golden or the lilies white and yellow or the sombre waving rushes or the sedges or the orchis or the blue forget me nots throw the lumber over man let your boat of life be light packed with only what you need a homely home and simple pleasures one or two friends worth the name someone to love and someone to love you a cat a dog and a pipe or two enough to eat and enough to wear and a little more than enough to drink for thirst is a dangerous thing you will find the boat easier to pull then and it will not be so liable to upset and it will not matter so much if it does upset good plain merchandise will stand water you will have time to think as well as to work time to drink in life s sunshine time to listen to the olian music that the wind of god draws from the human heart strings around us time to i beg your pardon really i quite forgot well we left the list to george and he began it tent we won t take a tent suggested george we will have a boat with a cover it is ever so much simpler and more comfortable it seemed a good thought and we adopted it i do not know whether you have ever seen the thing i mean you fix iron hoops up over the boat and stretch a huge canvas over them and fasten it down all round from stem to stern and it converts the boat into a sort of little house and it is beautifully cosy though a trifle stuffy but there everything has its drawbacks as the man said when his mother in law died and they came down upon him for the funeral expenses george said that in that case we must take a rug each a lamp some soap a brush and comb between us a toothbrush each a basin some tooth powder some shaving tackle sounds like a french exercise doesn t it and a couple of big towels for bathing i notice that people always make gigantic arrangements

for bathing when they are going anywhere near the water but that they don t bathe much when they are there sea side sceneit is the same when you go to the sea side i always determine when thinking over the matter in london that i ll get up early every morning and go and have a dip before breakfast and i religiously pack up a pair of drawers and a bath towel i always get red bathing drawers i rather fancy myself in red drawers they suit my complexion so but when i get to the sea i don t feel somehow that i want that early morning bathe nearly so much as i did when i was in town on the contrary i feel more that i want to stop in bed till the last moment and then come down and have my breakfast once or twice virtue has triumphed and i have got out at six and half dressed myself and have taken my drawers and towel and stumbled dismally off but i haven t enjoyed it they seem to keep a specially cutting east wind waiting for me when i go to bathe in the early morning and they pick out all the three cornered stones and put them on the top and they sharpen up the rocks and cover the points over with a bit of sand so that i can t see them and they take the sea and put it two miles out so that i have to huddle myself up in my arms and hop shivering through six inches of water and when i do get to the sea it is rough and quite insulting one huge wave catches me up and chucks me in a sitting posture as hard as ever it can down on to a rock which has been put there for me and before i ve said oh ugh and found out what has gone the wave comes back and carries me out to mid ocean i begin to strike out frantically for the shore and wonder if i shall ever see home and friends again and wish i d been kinder to my little sister when a boy when i was a boy i mean just when i have given up all hope a wave retires and leaves me sprawling like a star fish on the sand and i get up and look back and find that i ve been swimming for my life in two feet of water i hop back and dress and crawl home where i have to pretend i liked it in the present instance we all talked as if we were going to have a long swim every morning george said it was so pleasant to wake up in the boat in the fresh morning and plunge into the limpid river harris said there was nothing like a swim before breakfast to give you an appetite he said it always gave him an appetite george said that if it was going to make harris eat more than harris ordinarily ate then he should protest against harris having a bath at all he said there would be quite enough hard work in towing sufficient food for harris up against stream as it was i urged upon george however how much pleasanter it would be to have harris clean and fresh about the boat even if we did have to take a few more hundredweight of provisions and he got to see it in my light and withdrew his opposition to harris s bath agreed finally that we should take three bath towels so as not to keep each other waiting for clothes george said two suits of flannel would be sufficient as we could wash them ourselves in the river when they got dirty we asked him if he had ever tried washing flannels in the river and he replied no not exactly himself like but he knew some fellows who had and it was easy enough and harris and i were weak enough to fancy he knew what he was talking about and that three respectable young men without position or influence and with no experience in washing could really clean their own shirts and trousers in the river thames with a bit of soap we were to learn in the days to come when it was too late that george was a miserable impostor who could evidently have known nothing whatever about the matter if you had seen these clothes after but as the shilling shockers say we anticipate george impressed upon us to take a change of under things and plenty of socks in case we got upset and wanted a change also plenty of handkerchiefs as they would do to wipe things and a pair of leather boots as well as our boating shoes as we should want them if we got upset chapter iv the food question objections to paraffine oil as an atmosphere advantages of cheese as a travelling companion a married woman deserts her home further provision for getting upset i pack cussedness of tooth brushes george and harris pack awful behaviour of montmorency we retire to rest then we discussed the food question george said begin with breakfast george is so practical now for breakfast we shall want a frying pan harris said it was indigestible but we merely urged him not to be an ass and george went on a tea pot and a kettle and a methylated spirit stove no oil said george with a significant look and harris and i agreed we had taken up an oil stove once but never again it had been like living in an oil shop that week it oozed i never saw such a thing as paraffine oil is to ooze we kept it in the nose of the boat and from there it oozed down to the rudder impregnating the whole boat and everything in it on its way and it oozed over the river and saturated the scenery and spoilt the atmosphere sometimes a westerly oily wind blew and at other times an easterly oily wind and sometimes it blew a northerly oily wind and maybe a southerly oily wind but whether it came from the arctic snows or was raised in the waste of the desert sands it came alike to us laden with the fragrance of paraffine oil and that oil oozed up and ruined the sunset and as for the moonbeams they positively reeked of paraffine we tried to get away from it at marlow we left the boat by the bridge and took a walk through the town to escape it but it followed us the whole town was full of oil we passed through the church yard and it seemed as if the people had been buried in oil the high street stunk of oil we wondered how people could live in it and we walked miles upon miles out birmingham way but it was no use the country was steeped in oil at the end of that trip we met together at midnight in a lonely field under a blasted oak and took an awful oath we had been swearing for a whole week about the thing in an ordinary middle class way but this was a swell affair an awful oath never to take paraffine oil with us in a boat again except of course in case of sickness therefore in the present instance we confined ourselves to methylated spirit even that is bad enough you get methylated pie and methylated cake but methylated spirit is more wholesome when taken into the system in large quantities than paraffine oil for other breakfast things george suggested eggs and bacon which were easy to cook cold meat tea bread and butter and jam for lunch he said we could have biscuits cold meat bread and butter and jam but no cheese cheese like oil makes too much of itself it wants the whole boat to itself it goes through the hamper and gives a cheesy flavour to everything else there you can t tell whether you are eating apple pie or german sausage or strawberries and cream it all seems cheese there is too much odour about cheese i remember a friend of mine buying a couple of cheeses at liverpool splendid cheeses they were ripe and mellow and with a two hundred horse power scent about them that might have been warranted to carry three miles and knock a man over at two hundred yards i was in liverpool at the time and my friend said that if i didn t mind he would get me to take them back with me to london as he should not be coming up for a day or two himself and he did not think the cheeses ought to be kept much longer oh with pleasure dear boy i replied with pleasure i called for the cheeses and took them away in a cab it was a ramshackle affair dragged along by a knock kneed broken winded somnambulist which his owner in a moment of enthusiasm during conversation referred to as a horse i put the cheeses on the top and we started off at a shamble that would have done credit to the swiftest steam roller ever built and all went merry as a funeral bell until we turned the corner there the wind carried a whiff from the cheeses full on to our steed it woke him up and with a snort of terror he dashed off at three miles an hour the wind still blew in his direction and before we reached the end of the street he was laying himself out at the rate of nearly four miles an hour leaving the cripples and stout old ladies simply nowhere it took two porters as well as the driver to hold him in at the station and i do not think they would have done it even then had not one of the men had the presence of mind to put a handkerchief over his nose and to light a bit of brown paper i took my ticket and marched proudly up the platform with my cheeses the people falling back respectfully on either side the train was crowded and i had to get into a carriage where there were already seven other people one crusty old gentleman objected but i got in notwithstanding and putting my cheeses upon the rack squeezed down with a pleasant smile and said it was a warm day a few moments passed and then the old gentleman began to fidget very close in here he said quite oppressive said the man next him and then they both began sniffing and at the third sniff they caught it right on the chest and rose up without another word and went out and then a stout lady got up and said it was disgraceful that a respectable married woman should be harried about in this way and gathered up a bag and eight parcels and went the remaining four passengers sat on for a while until a solemn looking man in the corner who from his dress and general appearance seemed to belong to the undertaker class said it put him in mind of dead baby and the other three passengers tried to get out of the door at the same time and hurt themselves railway carriage i smiled at the black gentleman and said i thought we were going to have the carriage to ourselves and he laughed pleasantly and said that some people made such a fuss over a little thing but even he grew strangely depressed after we had started and so when we reached crewe i asked him to come and

asked to come

stock and

have a drink he accepted and we forced our way into the buffet where we yelled and stamped and waved our umbrellas for a quarter of an hour and then a young lady came and asked us if we wanted anything what s yours i said turning to my friend i ll have half a crown s worth of brandy neat if you please miss he responded and he went off quietly after he had drunk it and got into another carriage which i thought mean from crewe i had the compartment to myself though the train was crowded as we drew up at the different stations the people seeing my empty carriage would rush for it here y are maria come along plenty of room all right tom we ll get in here they would shout and they would run along carrying heavy bags and fight round the door to get in first and one would open the door and mount the steps and stagger back into the arms of the man behind him and they would all come and have a sniff and then droop off and squeeze into other carriages or pay the difference and go first from euston i took the cheeses down to my friend s house when his wife came into the room she smelt round for an instant then she said what is it tell me the worst i said it s cheeses tom bought them in liverpool and asked me to bring them up with me and i added that i hoped she understood that it had nothing to do with me and she said that she was sure of that but that she would speak to tom about it when he came back my friend was detained in liverpool longer than he expected and three days later as he hadn t returned home his wife called on me she said what did tom say about those cheeses i replied that he had directed they were to be kept in a moist place and that nobody was to touch them she said nobody s likely to touch them had he smelt them i thought he had and added that he seemed greatly attached to them you think he would be upset she queried if i gave a man a sovereign to take them away and bury them i answered that i thought he would never smile again an idea struck her she said do you mind keeping them for him let me send them round to you madam i replied for myself i like the smell of cheese and the journey the other day with them from liverpool i shall ever look back upon as a happy ending to a pleasant holiday but in this world we must consider others the lady under whose roof i have the honour of residing is a widow and for all i know possibly an orphan too she has a strong i may say an eloquent objection to being what she terms put upon the presence of your husband s cheeses in her house she would i instinctively feel regard as a put upon and it shall never be said that i put upon the widow and the orphan very well then said my friend s wife rising all i have to say is that i shall take the children and go to an hotel until those cheeses are eaten i decline to live any longer in the same house with them she kept her word leaving the place in charge of the charwoman who when asked if she could stand the smell replied what smell and who when taken close to the cheeses and told to sniff hard said she could detect a faint odour of melons it was argued from this that little injury could result to the woman from the atmosphere and she was left the hotel bill came to fifteen guineas and my friend after reckoning everything up found that the cheeses had cost him eight and sixpence a pound he said he dearly loved a bit of cheese but it was beyond his means so he determined to get rid of them he threw them into the canal but had to fish them out again as the bargemen complained they said it made them feel quite faint and after that he took them one dark night and left them in the parish mortuary but the coroner discovered them and made a fearful fuss he said it was a plot to deprive him of his living by waking up the corpses my friend got rid of them at last by taking them down to a sea side town and burying them on the beach it gained the place quite a reputation visitors said they had never noticed before how strong the air was and weak chested and consumptive people used to throng there for years afterwards fond as i am of cheese therefore i hold that george was right in declining to take any we shan t want any tea said george harris s face fell at this but we ll have a good round square slap up meal at seven dinner tea and supper combined harris grew more cheerful george suggested meat and fruit pies cold meat tomatoes fruit and green stuff for drink we took some wonderful sticky concoction of harris s which you mixed with water and called lemonade plenty of tea and a bottle of whisky in case as george said we got upset it seemed to me that george harped too much on the getting upset idea it seemed to me the wrong spirit to go about the trip in but i m glad we took the whisky we didn t take beer or wine they are a mistake up the river they make you feel sleepy and heavy a glass in the evening when you are doing a mouch round the town and looking at the girls is all right enough but don t drink when the sun is blazing down on your head and you ve got hard work to do we made a list of the things to be taken and a pretty lengthy one it was before we parted that evening the next day which was friday we got them all together and met in the evening to pack we got a big gladstone for the clothes and a couple of hampers for the victuals and the cooking utensils we moved the table up against the window piled everything in a heap in the middle of the floor and sat round and looked at it i said i d pack i rather pride myself on my packing packing is one of those many things that i feel i know more about than any other person living it surprises me myself sometimes how many of these subjects there are i impressed the fact upon george and harris and told them that they had better leave the whole matter entirely to me they fell into the suggestion with a readiness that had something uncanny about it george put on a pipe and spread himself over the easy chair and harris cocked his legs on the table and lit a cigar this was hardly what i intended what i had meant of course was that i should boss the job and that harris and george should potter about under my directions i pushing them aside every now and then with oh you here let me do it there you are simple enough really teaching them as you might say their taking it in the way they did irritated me there is nothing does irritate me more than seeing other people sitting about doing nothing when i m working i lived with a man once who used to make me mad that way he would loll on the sofa and watch me doing things by the hour together following me round the room with his eyes wherever i went he said it did him real good to look on at me messing about he said it made him feel that life was not an idle dream to be gaped and yawned through but a noble task full of duty and stern work he said he often wondered now how he could have gone on before he met me never having anybody to look at while they worked now i m not like that i can t sit still and see another man slaving and working i want to get up and superintend and walk round with my hands in my pockets and tell him what to do it is my energetic nature i can t help it however i did not say anything but started the packing it seemed a longer job than i had thought it was going to be but i got the bag finished at last and i sat on it and strapped it ain t you going to put the boots in said harris and i looked round and found i had forgotten them that s just like harris he couldn t have said a word until i d got the bag shut and strapped of course and george laughed one of those irritating senseless chuckle headed crack jawed laughs of his they do make me so wild i opened the bag and packed the boots in and then just as i was going to close it a horrible idea occurred to me had i packed my tooth brush i don t know how it is but i never do know whether i ve packed my tooth brush my tooth brush is a thing that haunts me when i m travelling and makes my life a misery i dream that i haven t packed it and wake up in a cold perspiration and get out of bed and hunt for it and in the morning i pack it before i have used it and have to unpack again to get it and it is always the last thing i turn out of the bag and then i repack and forget it and have to rush upstairs for it at the last moment and carry it to the railway station wrapped up in my pocket handkerchief bootof course i had to turn every mortal thing out now and of course i could not find it i rummaged the things up into much the same state that they must have been before the world was created and when chaos reigned of course i found george s and harris s eighteen times over but i couldn t find my own i put the things back one by one and held everything up and shook it then i found it inside a boot i repacked once more when i had finished george asked if the soap was in i said i didn t care a hang whether the soap was in or whether it wasn t and i slammed the bag to and strapped it and found that i had packed my tobacco pouch in it and had to re open it it got shut up finally at p m and then there remained the hampers to do harris said that we should be wanting to start in less than twelve hours time and thought that he and george had better do the rest and i agreed and sat down and they had a go they began in a light hearted spirit evidently intending to show me how to do it i made no comment i only waited when george is hanged harris will be the worst packer in this world and i looked at the piles of plates and cups and kettles and bottles and jars and pies and stoves and cakes and tomatoes c and felt that the thing would soon become exciting it did they started with breaking a cup that was the first thing they did they did that just to show you what they could do and to get you interested then harris packed the strawberry jam on top of a tomato and squashed it and they had to pick out the tomato with a teaspoon and then it was george s turn and he trod on the butter i didn t say

and then it was knap george s pacht turn and he
12
bvt trod suku on the butter i didn ipm roguy t say
1997
anything but i came over and sat on the edge of the table and watched them it irritated them more than anything i could have said i felt that it made them nervous and excited and they stepped on things and put things behind them and then couldn t find them when they wanted them and they packed the pies at the bottom and put heavy things on top and smashed the pies in they upset salt over everything and as for the butter i never saw two men do more with one and twopence worth of butter in my whole life than they did after george had got it off his slipper they tried to put it in the kettle it wouldn t go in and what was in wouldn t come out they did scrape it out at last and put it down on a chair and harris sat on it and it stuck to him and they went looking for it all over the room i ll take my oath i put it down on that chair said george staring at the empty seat i saw you do it myself not a minute ago said harris then they started round the room again looking for it and then they met again in the centre and stared at one another most extraordinary thing i ever heard of said george so mysterious said harris then george got round at the back of harris and saw it why here it is all the time he exclaimed indignantly where cried harris spinning round stand still can t you roared george flying after him and they got it off and packed it in the teapot montmorency was in it all of course montmorency s ambition in life is to get in the way and be sworn at if he can squirm in anywhere where he particularly is not wanted and be a perfect nuisance and make people mad and have things thrown at his head then he feels his day has not been wasted to get somebody to stumble over him and curse him steadily for an hour is his highest aim and object and when he has succeeded in accomplishing this his conceit becomes quite unbearable he came and sat down on things just when they were wanted to be packed and he laboured under the fixed belief that whenever harris or george reached out their hand for anything it was his cold damp nose that they wanted he put his leg into the jam and he worried the teaspoons and he pretended that the lemons were rats and got into the hamper and killed three of them before harris could land him with the frying pan harris said i encouraged him i didn t encourage him a dog like that don t want any encouragement it s the natural original sin that is born in him that makes him do things like that the packing was done at and harris sat on the big hamper and said he hoped nothing would be found broken george said that if anything was broken it was broken which reflection seemed to comfort him he also said he was ready for bed we were all ready for bed harris was to sleep with us that night and we went upstairs we tossed for beds and harris had to sleep with me he said do you prefer the inside or the outside j i said i generally preferred to sleep inside a bed harris said it was old george said what time shall i wake you fellows harris said seven i said no six because i wanted to write some letters harris and i had a bit of a row over it but at last split the difference and said half past six wake us at george we said george made no answer and we found on going over that he had been asleep for some time so we placed the bath where he could tumble into it on getting out in the morning and went to bed ourselves luggage with dog on top chapter v mrs p arouses us george the sluggard the weather forecast swindle our luggage depravity of the small boy the people gather round us we drive off in great style and arrive at waterloo innocence of south western officials concerning such worldly things as trains we are afloat afloat in an open boat mrs poppetsit was mrs poppets that woke me up next morning she said do you know that it s nearly nine o clock sir nine o what i cried starting up nine o clock she replied through the keyhole i thought you was a oversleeping yourselves i woke harris and told him he said i thought you wanted to get up at six so i did i answered why didn t you wake me how could i wake you when you didn t wake me he retorted now we shan t get on the water till after twelve i wonder you take the trouble to get up at all um i replied lucky for you that i do if i hadn t woke you you d have lain there for the whole fortnight george snoringwe snarled at one another in this strain for the next few minutes when we were interrupted by a defiant snore from george it reminded us for the first time since our being called of his existence there he lay the man who had wanted to know what time he should wake us on his back with his mouth wide open and his knees stuck up i don t know why it should be i am sure but the sight of another man asleep in bed when i am up maddens me it seems to me so shocking to see the precious hours of a man s life the priceless moments that will never come back to him again being wasted in mere brutish sleep there was george throwing away in hideous sloth the inestimable gift of time his valuable life every second of which he would have to account for hereafter passing away from him unused he might have been up stuffing himself with eggs and bacon irritating the dog or flirting with the slavey instead of sprawling there sunk in soul clogging oblivion it was a terrible thought harris and i appeared to be struck by it at the same instant we determined to save him and in this noble resolve our own dispute was forgotten we flew across and slung the clothes off him and harris landed him one with a slipper and i shouted in his ear and he awoke wasermarrer he observed sitting up get up you fat headed chunk roared harris it s quarter to ten what he shrieked jumping out of bed into the bath who the thunder put this thing here we told him he must have been a fool not to see the bath we finished dressing and when it came to the extras we remembered that we had packed the tooth brushes and the brush and comb that tooth brush of mine will be the death of me i know and we had to go downstairs and fish them out of the bag and when we had done that george wanted the shaving tackle we told him that he would have to go without shaving that morning as we weren t going to unpack that bag again for him nor for anyone like him he said don t be absurd how can i go into the city like this it was certainly rather rough on the city but what cared we for human suffering as harris said in his common vulgar way the city would have to lump it two dogs and umbrellawe went downstairs to breakfast montmorency had invited two other dogs to come and see him off and they were whiling away the time by fighting on the doorstep we calmed them with an umbrella and sat down to chops and cold beef harris said the great thing is to make a good breakfast and he started with a couple of chops saying that he would take these while they were hot as the beef could wait george got hold of the paper and read us out the boating fatalities and the weather forecast which latter prophesied rain cold wet to fine whatever more than usually ghastly thing in weather that may be occasional local thunder storms east wind with general depression over the midland counties london and channel bar falling i do think that of all the silly irritating tomfoolishness by which we are plagued this weather forecast fraud is about the most aggravating it forecasts precisely what happened yesterday or the day before and precisely the opposite of what is going to happen to day i remember a holiday of mine being completely ruined one late autumn by our paying attention to the weather report of the local newspaper heavy showers with thunderstorms may be expected to day it would say on monday and so we would give up our picnic and stop indoors all day waiting for the rain and people would pass the house going off in wagonettes and coaches as jolly and merry as could be the sun shining out and not a cloud to be seen ah we said as we stood looking out at them through the window won t they come home soaked and we chuckled to think how wet they were going to get and came back and stirred the fire and got our books and arranged our specimens of seaweed and cockle shells by twelve o clock with the sun pouring into the room the heat became quite oppressive and we wondered when those heavy showers and occasional thunderstorms were going to begin ah they ll come in the afternoon you ll find we said to each other oh won t those people get wet what a lark at one o clock the landlady would come in to ask if we weren t going out as it seemed such a lovely day no no we replied with a knowing chuckle not we we don t mean to get wet no no and when the afternoon was nearly gone and still there was no sign of rain we tried to cheer ourselves up with the idea that it would come down all at once just as the people had started for home and were out of the reach of any shelter and that they would thus get more drenched than ever but not a drop ever fell and it finished a grand day and a lovely night after it the next morning we would read that it was going to be a warm fine to set fair day much heat and we would dress ourselves in flimsy things and go out and half an hour after we had started it would commence to rain hard and a bitterly cold wind would spring up and both would keep on steadily for the whole day and we would come home with colds and rheumatism all over us and go to bed the weather is a thing that is beyond me altogether i never can understand it the barometer is useless it is as misleading as the newspaper forecast there was one hanging up in a hotel at oxford at which i was staying last spring and when i got there it was pointing to set fair it was simply pouring with rain outside and had been all day and i couldn t quite make matters out i tapped the barometer and it jumped up and pointed to very dry the boots stopped as he was passing and said he expected it meant to morrow i fancied that maybe it was thinking of the week before last but boots said no he

that it going to be benny a warm fine to soler set

we would dress

ourselves in flimsy things and sumo go out seora half strop an hour after we started it would commence to rain theow

aotus and pols both keep steadily for the whole day

and we would
4
come sents home with
6
colds rheumatism all over and go
4
to bed the weather
7
is a thing that is beyond me
23
understand wramp it faulx barometer sowel is useless it is as brute misleading as wads the newspaper forecast there was one lerwa hanging
7
up in a hotel woo at oxford
7
at thein which i was staying last
3
and when i
9
got there it clads was sahib pointing to set
1
pans
6
was debs pouring scruf with rain
2
pichi and
1
had
6
been day and moper i couldn
1
t
2
quite make
6
out i the barometer and ethos
1
it
3
jumped wises and
27
pointed to very dry whiff the boots stopped moier was passing and said he expected pod it meant burez to nuke morrow i gulae nitid fancied ritz
6
that maybe sophy was pinna thinking
11
of the touts week before hajib last but boots said airer
1
psw
2
topo he
1984
thought not i tapped it again the next morning and it went up still higher and the rain came down faster than ever on wednesday i went and hit it again and the pointer went round towards set fair very dry and much heat until it was stopped by the peg and couldn t go any further it tried its best but the instrument was built so that it couldn t prophesy fine weather any harder than it did without breaking itself it evidently wanted to go on and prognosticate drought and water famine and sunstroke and simooms and such things but the peg prevented it and it had to be content with pointing to the mere commonplace very dry meanwhile the rain came down in a steady torrent and the lower part of the town was under water owing to the river having overflowed boots said it was evident that we were going to have a prolonged spell of grand weather some time and read out a poem which was printed over the top of the oracle about long foretold long last short notice soon past the fine weather never came that summer i expect that machine must have been referring to the following spring then there are those new style of barometers the long straight ones i never can make head or tail of those there is one side for a m yesterday and one side for a m to day but you can t always get there as early as ten you know it rises or falls for rain and fine with much or less wind and one end is nly and the other ely what s ely got to do with it and if you tap it it doesn t tell you anything and you ve got to correct it to sea level and reduce it to fahrenheit and even then i don t know the answer but who wants to be foretold the weather it is bad enough when it comes without our having the misery of knowing about it beforehand the prophet we like is the old man who on the particularly gloomy looking morning of some day when we particularly want it to be fine looks round the horizon with a particularly knowing eye and says oh no sir i think it will clear up all right it will break all right enough sir ah he knows we say as we wish him good morning and start off wonderful how these old fellows can tell and we feel an affection for that man which is not at all lessened by the circumstances of its not clearing up but continuing to rain steadily all day ah well we feel he did his best for the man that prophesies us bad weather on the contrary we entertain only bitter and revengeful thoughts going to clear up d ye think we shout cheerily as we pass well no sir i m afraid it s settled down for the day he replies shaking his head stupid old fool we mutter what s he know about it and if his portent proves correct we come back feeling still more angry against him and with a vague notion that somehow or other he has had something to do with it it was too bright and sunny on this especial morning for george s blood curdling readings about bar falling atmospheric disturbance passing in an oblique line over southern europe and pressure increasing to very much upset us and so finding that he could not make us wretched and was only wasting his time he sneaked the cigarette that i had carefully rolled up for myself and went then harris and i having finished up the few things left on the table carted out our luggage on to the doorstep and waited for a cab the luggage there seemed a good deal of luggage when we put it all together there was the gladstone and the small hand bag and the two hampers and a large roll of rugs and some four or five overcoats and macintoshes and a few umbrellas and then there was a melon by itself in a bag because it was too bulky to go in anywhere and a couple of pounds of grapes in another bag and a japanese paper umbrella and a frying pan which being too long to pack we had wrapped round with brown paper it did look a lot and harris and i began to feel rather ashamed of it though why we should be i can t see no cab came by but the street boys did and got interested in the show apparently and stopped biggs s boy was the first to come round biggs is our greengrocer and his chief talent lies in securing the services of the most abandoned and unprincipled errand boys that civilisation has as yet produced if anything more than usually villainous in the boy line crops up in our neighbourhood we know that it is biggs s latest i was told that at the time of the great coram street murder it was promptly concluded by our street that biggs s boy for that period was at the bottom of it and had he not been able in reply to the severe cross examination to which he was subjected by no when he called there for orders the morning after the crime assisted by no who happened to be on the step at the time to prove a complete alibi it would have gone hard with him i didn t know biggs s boy at that time but from what i have seen of them since i should not have attached much importance to that alibi myself biggs s boy as i have said came round the corner he was evidently in a great hurry when he first dawned upon the vision but on catching sight of harris and me and montmorency and the things he eased up and stared harris and i frowned at him this might have wounded a more sensitive nature but biggs s boys are not as a rule touchy he came to a dead stop a yard from our step and leaning up against the railings and selecting a straw to chew fixed us with his eye he evidently meant to see this thing out in another moment the grocer s boy passed on the opposite side of the street biggs s boy hailed him hi ground floor o s a moving the grocer s boy came across and took up a position on the other side of the step then the young gentleman from the boot shop stopped and joined biggs s boy while the empty can superintendent from the blue posts took up an independent position on the curb they ain t a going to starve are they said the gentleman from the boot shop ah you d want to take a thing or two with you retorted the blue posts if you was a going to cross the atlantic in a small boat they ain t a going to cross the atlantic struck in biggs s boy they re a going to find stanley by this time quite a small crowd had collected and people were asking each other what was the matter one party the young and giddy portion of the crowd held that it was a wedding and pointed out harris as the bridegroom while the elder and more thoughtful among the populace inclined to the idea that it was a funeral and that i was probably the corpse s brother at last an empty cab turned up it is a street where as a rule and when they are not wanted empty cabs pass at the rate of three a minute and hang about and get in your way and packing ourselves and our belongings into it and shooting out a couple of montmorency s friends who had evidently sworn never to forsake him we drove away amidst the cheers of the crowd biggs s boy shying a carrot after us for luck we got to waterloo at eleven and asked where the eleven five started from of course nobody knew nobody at waterloo ever does know where a train is going to start from or where a train when it does start is going to or anything about it the porter who took our things thought it would go from number two platform while another porter with whom he discussed the question had heard a rumour that it would go from number one the station master on the other hand was convinced it would start from the local to put an end to the matter we went upstairs and asked the traffic superintendent and he told us that he had just met a man who said he had seen it at number three platform we went to number three platform but the authorities there said that they rather thought that train was the southampton express or else the windsor loop but they were sure it wasn t the kingston train though why they were sure it wasn t they couldn t say then our porter said he thought that must be it on the high level platform said he thought he knew the train so we went to the high level platform and saw the engine driver and asked him if he was going to kingston he said he couldn t say for certain of course but that he rather thought he was anyhow if he wasn t the for kingston he said he was pretty confident he was the for virginia water or the a m express for the isle of wight or somewhere in that direction and we should all know when we got there we slipped half a crown into his hand and begged him to be the for kingston nobody will ever know on this line we said what you are or where you re going you know the way you slip off quietly and go to kingston well i don t know gents replied the noble fellow but i suppose some train s got to go to kingston and i ll do it gimme the half crown thus we got to kingston by the london and south western railway we learnt afterwards that the train we had come by was really the exeter mail and that they had spent hours at waterloo looking for it and nobody knew what had become of it our boat was waiting for us at kingston just below bridge and to it we wended our way and round it we stored our luggage and into it we stepped are you all right sir said the man right it is we answered and with harris at the sculls and i at the tiller lines and montmorency unhappy and deeply suspicious in the prow out we shot on to the waters which for a fortnight were to be our home chapter vi kingston instructive remarks on early english history instructive observations on carved oak and life in general

to take it when the dainty sheen of grass and leaf is blushing to a deeper green and the year seems like a fair young maid trembling with strange wakening pulses on the brink of womanhood the quaint

grunting away at the sculls the distant glimpses of the grey old palace of the tudors all made a sunny picture so bright but calm so full of life and yet so peaceful that early in the day though it was i felt myself being dreamily lulled off into a musing fit i mused on kingston or kyningestun as it was once called in the days when saxon kinges were crowned there great c sar crossed the river there and the roman legions camped upon its sloping uplands c sar like in later years elizabeth seems to have stopped everywhere only he was more respectable than good queen bess he didn t put up at the public houses she was nuts on public houses was england s virgin queen there s scarcely a pub of any attractions within ten miles of london that she does not seem to have looked in at or stopped at or slept at some time or other i wonder now supposing harris say turned over a new leaf and became a great and good man and got to be prime minister and died if they would put up signs over the public houses that he had patronised harris had a glass of bitter in this house harris had two of scotch cold here in the summer of harris was chucked from here in december no there would be too many of them it would be the houses that he had never entered that would become famous only house in south london that harris never had a drink in the people would flock to it to see what could have been the matter with it how poor weak minded king edwy must have hated kyningestun the coronation feast had been too much for him maybe boar s head stuffed with sugar plums did not agree with him it wouldn t with me i know and he had had enough of sack and mead so he slipped from the noisy revel to steal a quiet moonlight hour with his beloved elgiva perhaps from the casement standing hand in hand they were watching the calm moonlight on the river while from the distant halls the boisterous revelry floated in broken bursts of faint heard din and tumult then brutal odo and st dunstan force their rude way into the quiet room and hurl coarse insults at the sweet faced queen and drag poor edwy back to the loud clamour of the drunken brawl years later to the crash of battle music saxon kings and saxon revelry were buried side by side and kingston s greatness passed away for a time to rise once more when hampton court became the palace of the tudors and the stuarts and the royal barges strained at their moorings on the river s bank and bright cloaked gallants swaggered down the water steps to cry what ferry ho gadzooks gramercy many of the old houses round about speak very plainly of those days when kingston was a royal borough and nobles and courtiers lived there near their king and the long road to the palace gates was gay all day with clanking steel and prancing palfreys and rustling silks and velvets and fair faces the large and spacious houses with their oriel latticed windows their huge fireplaces and their gabled roofs breathe of the days of hose and doublet of pearl embroidered stomachers and complicated oaths they were upraised in the days when men knew how to build the hard red bricks have only grown more firmly set with time and their oak stairs do not creak and grunt when you try to go down them quietly speaking of oak staircases reminds me that there is a magnificent carved oak staircase in one of the houses in kingston it is a shop now in the market place but it was evidently once the mansion of some great personage a friend of mine who lives at kingston went in there to buy a hat one day and in a thoughtless moment put his hand in his pocket and paid for it then and there the shopman he knows my friend was naturally a little staggered at first but quickly recovering himself and feeling that something ought to be done to encourage this sort of thing asked our hero if he would like to see some fine old carved oak my friend said he would and the shopman thereupon took him through the shop and up the staircase of the house the balusters were a superb piece of workmanship and the wall all the way up was oak panelled with carving that would have done credit to a palace from the stairs they went into the drawing room which was a large bright room decorated with a somewhat startling though cheerful paper of a blue ground there was nothing however remarkable about the apartment and my friend wondered why he had been brought there the proprietor went up to the paper and tapped it it gave forth a wooden sound oak he explained all carved oak right up to the ceiling just the same as you saw on the staircase but great c sar man expostulated my friend you don t mean to say you have covered over carved oak with blue wall paper yes was the reply it was expensive work had to match board it all over first of course but the room looks cheerful now it was awful gloomy before i can t say i altogether blame the man which is doubtless a great relief to his mind from his point of view which would be that of the average householder desiring to take life as lightly as possible and not that of the old curiosity shop maniac there is reason on his side carved oak is very pleasant to look at and to have a little of but it is no doubt somewhat depressing to live in for those whose fancy does not lie that way it would be like living in a church no what was sad in his case was that he who didn t care for carved oak should have his drawing room panelled with it while people who do care for it have to pay enormous prices to get it it seems to be the rule of this world each person has what he doesn t want and other people have what he does want married men have wives and don t seem to want them and young single fellows cry out that they can t get them poor people who can hardly keep themselves have eight hearty children rich old couples with no one to leave their money to die childless then there are girls with lovers the girls that have lovers never want them they say they would rather be without them that they bother them and why don t they go and make love to miss smith and miss brown who are plain and elderly and haven t got any lovers they themselves don t want lovers they never mean to marry it does not do to dwell on these things it makes one so sad there was a boy at our school we used to call him sandford and merton his real name was stivvings he was the most extraordinary lad i ever came across i believe he really liked study he used to get into awful rows for sitting up in bed and reading greek and as for french irregular verbs there was simply no keeping him away from them he was full of weird and unnatural notions about being a credit to his parents and an honour to the school and he yearned to win prizes and grow up and be a clever man and had all those sorts of weak minded ideas i never knew such a strange creature yet harmless mind you as the babe unborn well that boy used to get ill about twice a week so that he couldn t go to school there never was such a boy to get ill as that sandford and merton if there was any known disease going within ten miles of him he had it and had it badly he would take bronchitis in the dog days and have hay fever at christmas after a six weeks period of drought he would be stricken down with rheumatic fever and he would go out in a november fog and come home with a sunstroke they put him under laughing gas one year poor lad and drew all his teeth and gave him a false set because he suffered so terribly with toothache and then it turned to neuralgia and ear ache he was never without a cold except once for nine weeks while he had scarlet fever and he always had chilblains during the great cholera scare of our neighbourhood was singularly free from it there was only one reputed case in the whole parish that case was young stivvings he had to stop in bed when he was ill and eat chicken and custards and hot house grapes and he would lie there and sob because they wouldn t let him do latin exercises and took his german grammar away from him and we other boys who would have sacrificed ten terms of our school life for the sake of being ill for a day and had no desire whatever to give our parents any excuse for being stuck up about us couldn t catch so much as a stiff neck we fooled about in draughts and it did us good and freshened us up and we took things to make us sick and they made us fat and gave us an appetite nothing we could think of seemed to make us ill until the holidays began then on the breaking up day we caught colds and whooping cough and all kinds of disorders which lasted till the term recommenced when in spite of everything we could man uvre to the contrary we would get suddenly well again and be better than ever such is life and we are but as grass that is cut down and put into the oven and baked to go back to the carved oak question they must have had very fair notions of the artistic and the beautiful our great great grandfathers why all our art treasures of to day are only the dug up commonplaces of three or four hundred years ago i wonder if there is real intrinsic beauty in the old soup plates beer mugs and candle snuffers that we prize so now or if it is only the halo of age glowing around them that gives them their charms in our eyes the old blue that we hang about our walls as ornaments were the common every day household utensils of a few centuries ago and the pink shepherds and the yellow shepherdesses that we hand round now for all our friends to gush over and pretend they understand were the unvalued mantel ornaments that the mother of the

and stood upon a bracket and dusted only by the lady of the house china dogthat china dog that ornaments the bedroom of my furnished lodgings it is a white dog its eyes blue its nose is a delicate red with spots its head is painfully erect its expression is amiability carried to verge of imbecility i do not admire it myself considered as a work of art i may say it irritates me thoughtless friends jeer at it and even my landlady herself has no admiration for it and excuses its presence by the circumstance that her aunt gave it to her but in years time it is more than probable that that dog will be dug up from somewhere or other minus its legs and with its tail broken and will be sold for old china and put in a glass cabinet and people will pass it round and admire it they will be struck by the wonderful depth of the colour on the nose and speculate as to how beautiful the bit of the tail that is lost no doubt was we in this age do not see the beauty of that dog we are too familiar with it it is like the sunset and the stars we are not awed by their loveliness because they are common to our eyes so it is with that china dog in people will gush over it the making of such dogs will have become a lost art our descendants will wonder how we did it and say how clever we were we shall be referred to lovingly as those grand old artists that flourished in the nineteenth century and produced those china dogs the sampler that the eldest daughter did at school will be spoken of as tapestry of the victorian era and be almost priceless the blue and white mugs of the present day roadside inn will be hunted up all cracked and chipped and sold for their weight in gold and rich people will use them for claret cups and travellers from japan will buy up all the presents from ramsgate and souvenirs of margate that may have escaped destruction and take them back to jedo as ancient english curios at this point harris threw away the sculls got up and left his seat and sat on his back and stuck his legs in the air montmorency howled and turned a somersault and the top hamper jumped up and all the things came out i was somewhat surprised but i did not lose my temper i said pleasantly enough hulloa what s that for what s that for why no on second thoughts i will not repeat what harris said i may have been to blame i admit it but nothing excuses violence of language and coarseness of expression especially in a man who has been carefully brought up as i know harris has been i was thinking of other things and forgot as any one might easily understand that i was steering and the consequence was that we had got mixed up a good deal with the tow path it was difficult to say for the moment which was us and which was the middlesex bank of the river but we found out after a while and separated ourselves harris however said he had done enough for a bit and proposed that i should take a turn so as we were in i got out and took the tow line and ran the boat on past hampton court what a dear old wall that is that runs along by the river there i never pass it without feeling better for the sight of it such a mellow bright sweet old wall what a charming picture it would make with the lichen creeping here and the moss growing there a shy young vine peeping over the top at this spot to see what is going on upon the busy river and the sober old ivy clustering a little farther down there are fifty shades and tints and hues in every ten yards of that old wall if i could only draw and knew how to paint i could make a lovely sketch of that old wall i m sure i ve often thought i should like to live at hampton court it looks so peaceful and so quiet and it is such a dear old place to ramble round in the early morning before many people are about but there i don t suppose i should really care for it when it came to actual practice it would be so ghastly dull and depressing in the evening when your lamp cast uncanny shadows on the panelled walls and the echo of distant feet rang through the cold stone corridors and now drew nearer and now died away and all was death like silence save the beating of one s own heart we are creatures of the sun we men and women we love light and life that is why we crowd into the towns and cities and the country grows more and more deserted every year in the sunlight in the daytime when nature is alive and busy all around us we like the open hill sides and the deep woods well enough but in the night when our mother earth has gone to sleep and left us waking oh the world seems so lonesome and we get frightened like children in a silent house then we sit and sob and long for the gas lit streets and the sound of human voices and the answering throb of human life we feel so helpless and so little in the great stillness when the dark trees rustle in the night wind there are so many ghosts about and their silent sighs make us feel so sad let us gather together in the great cities and light huge bonfires of a million gas jets and shout and sing together and feel brave people at hampton mazeharris asked me if i d ever been in the maze at hampton court he said he went in once to show somebody else the way he had studied it up in a map and it was so simple that it seemed foolish hardly worth the twopence charged for admission harris said he thought that map must have been got up as a practical joke because it wasn t a bit like the real thing and only misleading it was a country cousin that harris took in he said we ll just go in here so that you can say you ve been but it s very simple it s absurd to call it a maze you keep on taking the first turning to the right we ll just walk round for ten minutes and then go and get some lunch they met some people soon after they had got inside who said they had been there for three quarters of an hour and had had about enough of it harris told them they could follow him if they liked he was just going in and then should turn round and come out again they said it was very kind of him and fell behind and followed they picked up various other people who wanted to get it over as they went along until they had absorbed all the persons in the maze people who had given up all hopes of ever getting either in or out or of ever seeing their home and friends again plucked up courage at the sight of harris and his party and joined the procession blessing him harris said he should judge there must have been twenty people following him in all and one woman with a baby who had been there all the morning insisted on taking his arm for fear of losing him harris kept on turning to the right but it seemed a long way and his cousin said he supposed it was a very big maze oh one of the largest in europe said harris yes it must be replied the cousin because we ve walked a good two miles already harris began to think it rather strange himself but he held on until at last they passed the half of a penny bun on the ground that harris s cousin swore he had noticed there seven minutes ago harris said oh impossible but the woman with the baby said not at all as she herself had taken it from the child and thrown it down there just before she met harris she also added that she wished she never had met harris and expressed an opinion that he was an impostor that made harris mad and he produced his map and explained his theory the map may be all right enough said one of the party if you know whereabouts in it we are now harris didn t know and suggested that the best thing to do would be to go back to the entrance and begin again for the beginning again part of it there was not much enthusiasm but with regard to the advisability of going back to the entrance there was complete unanimity and so they turned and trailed after harris again in the opposite direction about ten minutes more passed and then they found themselves in the centre harris thought at first of pretending that that was what he had been aiming at but the crowd looked dangerous and he decided to treat it as an accident anyhow they had got something to start from then they did know where they were and the map was once more consulted and the thing seemed simpler than ever and off they started for the third time and three minutes later they were back in the centre again after that they simply couldn t get anywhere else whatever way they turned brought them back to the middle it became so regular at length that some of the people stopped there and waited for the others to take a walk round and come back to them harris drew out his map again after a while but the sight of it only infuriated the mob and they told him to go and curl his hair with it harris said that he couldn t help feeling that to a certain extent he had become unpopular they all got crazy at last and sang out for the keeper and the man came and climbed up the ladder outside and shouted out directions to them but all their heads were by this time in such a confused whirl that they were incapable of grasping anything and so the man told them to stop where they were and he would come to them they huddled together and waited and he climbed down and came in he was a young keeper as luck would have it and new to the business and when he got in he couldn t find them and he wandered about trying to get to them and then he got lost they caught sight of him every now and then rushing about the other side of the hedge and he would see them and rush to get to them and they would wait there for about five minutes and then he would reappear again in exactly the same spot and ask them where they had been they had to wait till one of the old keepers came back from his dinner before they got out harris said he thought it was a very fine maze so far as he was a judge and we agreed that we would try to get george to go into it on our way back chapter vii the river in its sunday garb dress on the river a chance for the men absence of taste in

the man who loves not graves and coffins and skulls harris mad his views on george and banks and lemonade he performs tricks it was while passing through moulsey lock that harris told me about his maze experience it took us some time to pass through as we were the only boat and it is a big lock i don t think i ever remember to have seen moulsey lock before with only one boat in it it is i suppose boulter s not even excepted the busiest lock on the river i have stood and watched it sometimes when you could not see any water at all but only a brilliant tangle of bright blazers and gay caps and saucy hats and many coloured parasols and silken rugs and cloaks and streaming ribbons and dainty whites when looking down into the lock from the quay you might fancy it was a huge box into which flowers of every hue and shade had been thrown pell mell and lay piled up in a rainbow heap that covered every corner on a fine sunday it presents this appearance nearly all day long while up the stream and down the stream lie waiting their turn outside the gates long lines of still more boats and boats are drawing near and passing away so that the sunny river from the palace up to hampton church is dotted and decked with yellow and blue and orange and white and red and pink all the inhabitants of hampton and moulsey dress themselves up in boating costume and come and mouch round the lock with their dogs and flirt and smoke and watch the boats and altogether what with the caps and jackets of the men the pretty coloured dresses of the women the excited dogs the moving boats the white sails the pleasant landscape and the sparkling water it is one of the gayest sights i know of near this dull old london town the river affords a good opportunity for dress for once in a way we men are able to show our taste in colours and i think we come out very natty if you ask me i always like a little red in my things red and black you know my hair is a sort of golden brown rather a pretty shade i ve been told and a dark red matches it beautifully and then i always think a light blue necktie goes so well with it and a pair of those russian leather shoes and a red silk handkerchief round the waist a handkerchief looks so much better than a belt harris always keeps to shades or mixtures of orange or yellow but i don t think he is at all wise in this his complexion is too dark for yellows yellows don t suit him there can be no question about it i want him to take to blue as a background with white or cream for relief but there the less taste a person has in dress the more obstinate he always seems to be it is a great pity because he will never be a success as it is while there are one or two colours in which he might not really look so bad with his hat on george has bought some new things for this trip and i m rather vexed about them the blazer is loud i should not like george to know that i thought so but there really is no other word for it he brought it home and showed it to us on thursday evening we asked him what colour he called it and he said he didn t know he didn t think there was a name for the colour the man had told him it was an oriental design george put it on and asked us what we thought of it harris said that as an object to hang over a flower bed in early spring to frighten the birds away he should respect it but that considered as an article of dress for any human being except a margate nigger it made him ill george got quite huffy but as harris said if he didn t want his opinion why did he ask for it what troubles harris and myself with regard to it is that we are afraid it will attract attention to the boat young ladygirls also don t look half bad in a boat if prettily dressed nothing is more fetching to my thinking than a tasteful boating costume but a boating costume it would be as well if all ladies would understand ought to be a costume that can be worn in a boat and not merely under a glass case it utterly spoils an excursion if you have folk in the boat who are thinking all the time a good deal more of their dress than of the trip it was my misfortune once to go for a water picnic with two ladies of this kind we did have a lively time they were both beautifully got up all lace and silky stuff and flowers and ribbons and dainty shoes and light gloves but they were dressed for a photographic studio not for a river picnic they were the boating costumes of a french fashion plate it was ridiculous fooling about in them anywhere near real earth air and water the first thing was that they thought the boat was not clean we dusted all the seats for them and then assured them that it was but they didn t believe us one of them rubbed the cushion with the forefinger of her glove and showed the result to the other and they both sighed and sat down with the air of early christian martyrs trying to make themselves comfortable up against the stake you are liable to occasionally splash a little when sculling and it appeared that a drop of water ruined those costumes the mark never came out and a stain was left on the dress for ever i was stroke i did my best i feathered some two feet high and i paused at the end of each stroke to let the blades drip before returning them and i picked out a smooth bit of water to drop them into again each time bow said after a while that he did not feel himself a sufficiently accomplished oarsman to pull with me but that he would sit still if i would allow him and study my stroke he said it interested him but notwithstanding all this and try as i would i could not help an occasional flicker of water from going over those dresses the girls did not complain but they huddled up close together and set their lips firm and every time a drop touched them they visibly shrank and shuddered it was a noble sight to see them suffering thus in silence but it unnerved me altogether i am too sensitive i got wild and fitful in my rowing and splashed more and more the harder i tried not to i gave it up at last i said i d row bow bow thought the arrangement would be better too and we changed places the ladies gave an involuntary sigh of relief when they saw me go and quite brightened up for a moment poor girls they had better have put up with me the man they had got now was a jolly light hearted thick headed sort of a chap with about as much sensitiveness in him as there might be in a newfoundland puppy you might look daggers at him for an hour and he would not notice it and it would not trouble him if he did he set a good rollicking dashing stroke that sent the spray playing all over the boat like a fountain and made the whole crowd sit up straight in no time when he spread more than pint of water over one of those dresses he would give a pleasant little laugh and say i beg your pardon i m sure and offer them his handkerchief to wipe it off with oh it s of no consequence the poor girls would murmur in reply and covertly draw rugs and coats over themselves and try and protect themselves with their lace parasols at lunch they had a very bad time of it people wanted them to sit on the grass and the grass was dusty and the tree trunks against which they were invited to lean did not appear to have been brushed for weeks so they spread their handkerchiefs on the ground and sat on those bolt upright somebody in walking about with a plate of beef steak pie tripped up over a root and sent the pie flying none of it went over them fortunately but the accident suggested a fresh danger to them and agitated them and whenever anybody moved about after that with anything in his hand that could fall and make a mess they watched that person with growing anxiety until he sat down again washing up now then you girls said our friend bow to them cheerily after it was all over come along you ve got to wash up they didn t understand him at first when they grasped the idea they said they feared they did not know how to wash up oh i ll soon show you he cried it s rare fun you lie down on your i mean you lean over the bank you know and sloush the things about in the water the elder sister said that she was afraid that they hadn t got on dresses suited to the work oh they ll be all right said he light heartedly tuck em up and he made them do it too he told them that that sort of thing was half the fun of a picnic they said it was very interesting now i come to think it over was that young man as dense headed as we thought or was he no impossible there was such a simple child like expression about him harris wanted to get out at hampton church to go and see mrs thomas s tomb who is mrs thomas i asked how should i know replied harris she s a lady that s got a funny tomb and i want to see it i objected i don t know whether it is that i am built wrong but i never did seem to hanker after tombstones myself i know that the proper thing to do when you get to a village or town is to rush off to the churchyard and enjoy the graves but it is a recreation that i always deny myself i take no interest in creeping round dim and chilly churches behind wheezy old men and reading epitaphs not even the sight of a bit of cracked brass let into a stone affords me what i call real happiness i shock respectable sextons by the imperturbability i am able to assume before exciting inscriptions and by my lack of enthusiasm for the local family history while my ill concealed anxiety to get outside wounds their feelings one golden morning of a sunny day i leant against the low stone wall that guarded a little village church and i smoked and drank in deep calm gladness from the sweet restful scene the grey old church with its clustering ivy and its quaint carved wooden porch the white lane winding down the hill between tall rows of elms the thatched roof cottages peeping above their trim kept hedges the silver river in the hollow the wooded hills beyond it was a lovely landscape it was idyllic poetical and it inspired me i felt good and noble i felt i didn t want to be sinful

and wicked any more i would come and live here and never do any more wrong and lead a blameless beautiful life and have silver hair when i got old and all that sort of thing in that moment i forgave all my friends and relations for their wickedness and cussedness and i blessed them they did not know that i blessed them they went their abandoned way all unconscious of what i far away in that peaceful village was doing for them but i did it and i wished that i could let them know that i had done it because i wanted to make them happy i was going on thinking away all these grand tender thoughts when my reverie was broken in upon by a shrill piping voice crying out all right sur i m a coming i m a coming it s all right sur don t you be in a hurry i looked up and saw an old bald headed man hobbling across the churchyard towards me carrying a huge bunch of keys in his hand that shook and jingled at every step i motioned him away with silent dignity but he still advanced screeching out the while i m a coming sur i m a coming i m a little lame i ain t as spry as i used to be this way sur go away you miserable old man i said i ve come as soon as i could sur he replied my missis never see you till just this minute you follow me sur go away i repeated leave me before i get over the wall and slay you he seemed surprised don t you want to see the tombs he said no i answered i don t i want to stop here leaning up against this gritty old wall go away and don t disturb me i am chock full of beautiful and noble thoughts and i want to stop like it because it feels nice and good don t you come fooling about making me mad chivying away all my better feelings with this silly tombstone nonsense of yours go away and get somebody to bury you cheap and i ll pay half the expense he was bewildered for a moment he rubbed his eyes and looked hard at me i seemed human enough on the outside he couldn t make it out he said yuise a stranger in these parts you don t live here graves no i said i don t you wouldn t if i did well then he said you want to see the tombs graves folks been buried you know coffins you are an untruther i replied getting roused i do not want to see tombs not your tombs why should i we have graves of our own our family has why my uncle podger has a tomb in kensal green cemetery that is the pride of all that country side and my grandfather s vault at bow is capable of accommodating eight visitors while my great aunt susan has a brick grave in finchley churchyard with a headstone with a coffee pot sort of thing in bas relief upon it and a six inch best white stone coping all the way round that cost pounds when i want graves it is to those places that i go and revel i do not want other folk s when you yourself are buried i will come and see yours that is all i can do for you he burst into tears he said that one of the tombs had a bit of stone upon the top of it that had been said by some to be probably part of the remains of the figure of a man and that another had some words carved upon it that nobody had ever been able to decipher i still remained obdurate and in broken hearted tones he said well won t you come and see the memorial window i would not even see that so he fired his last shot he drew near and whispered hoarsely i ve got a couple of skulls down in the crypt he said come and see those oh do come and see the skulls you are a young man out for a holiday and you want to enjoy yourself come and see the skulls skullsthen i turned and fled and as i sped i heard him calling to me oh come and see the skulls come back and see the skulls harris however revels in tombs and graves and epitaphs and monumental inscriptions and the thought of not seeing mrs thomas s grave made him crazy he said he had looked forward to seeing mrs thomas s grave from the first moment that the trip was proposed said he wouldn t have joined if it hadn t been for the idea of seeing mrs thomas s tomb i reminded him of george and how we had to get the boat up to shepperton by five o clock to meet him and then he went for george why was george to fool about all day and leave us to lug this lumbering old top heavy barge up and down the river by ourselves to meet him why couldn t george come and do some work why couldn t he have got the day off and come down with us bank be blowed what good was he at the bank i never see him doing any work there continued harris whenever i go in he sits behind a bit of glass all day trying to look as if he was doing something what s the good of a man behind a bit of glass i have to work for my living why can t he work what use is he there and what s the good of their banks they take your money and then when you draw a cheque they send it back smeared all over with no effects refer to drawer what s the good of that that s the sort of trick they served me twice last week i m not going to stand it much longer i shall withdraw my account if he was here we could go and see that tomb i don t believe he s at the bank at all he s larking about somewhere that s what he s doing leaving us to do all the work i m going to get out and have a drink i pointed out to him that we were miles away from a pub and then he went on about the river and what was the good of the river and was everyone who came on the river to die of thirst it is always best to let harris have his head when he gets like this then he pumps himself out and is quiet afterwards i reminded him that there was concentrated lemonade in the hamper and a gallon jar of water in the nose of the boat and that the two only wanted mixing to make a cool and refreshing beverage then he flew off about lemonade and such like sunday school slops as he termed them ginger beer raspberry syrup c c he said they all produced dyspepsia and ruined body and soul alike and were the cause of half the crime in england he said he must drink something however and climbed upon the seat and leant over to get the bottle it was right at the bottom of the hamper and seemed difficult to find and he had to lean over further and further and in trying to steer at the same time from a topsy turvy point of view he pulled the wrong line and sent the boat into the bank and the shock upset him and he dived down right into the hamper and stood there on his head holding on to the sides of the boat like grim death his legs sticking up into the air he dared not move for fear of going over and had to stay there till i could get hold of his legs and haul him back and that made him madder than ever chapter viii blackmailing the proper course to pursue selfish boorishness of river side landowner notice boards unchristianlike feelings of harris how harris sings a comic song a high class party shameful conduct of two abandoned young men some useless information george buys a banjo we stopped under the willows by kempton park and lunched it is a pretty little spot there a pleasant grass plateau running along by the water s edge and overhung by willows we had just commenced the third course the bread and jam when a gentleman in shirt sleeves and a short pipe came along and wanted to know if we knew that we were trespassing we said we hadn t given the matter sufficient consideration as yet to enable us to arrive at a definite conclusion on that point but that if he assured us on his word as a gentleman that we were trespassing we would without further hesitation believe it he gave us the required assurance and we thanked him but he still hung about and seemed to be dissatisfied so we asked him if there was anything further that we could do for him and harris who is of a chummy disposition offered him a bit of bread and jam i fancy he must have belonged to some society sworn to abstain from bread and jam for he declined it quite gruffly as if he were vexed at being tempted with it and he added that it was his duty to turn us off harris said that if it was a duty it ought to be done and asked the man what was his idea with regard to the best means for accomplishing it harris is what you would call a well made man of about number one size and looks hard and bony and the man measured him up and down and said he would go and consult his master and then come back and chuck us both into the river of course we never saw him any more and of course all he really wanted was a shilling there are a certain number of riverside roughs who make quite an income during the summer by slouching about the banks and blackmailing weak minded noodles in this way they represent themselves as sent by the proprietor the proper course to pursue is to offer your name and address and leave the owner if he really has anything to do with the matter to summon you and prove what damage you have done to his land by sitting down on a bit of it but the majority of people are so intensely lazy and timid that they prefer to encourage the imposition by giving in to it rather than put an end to it by the exertion of a little firmness where it is really the owners that are to blame they ought to be shown up the selfishness of the riparian proprietor grows with every year if these men had their way they would close the river thames altogether they actually do this along the minor tributary streams and in the backwaters they drive posts into the bed of the stream and draw chains across from bank to bank and nail huge notice boards on every tree the sight of those notice boards rouses every evil instinct in my nature i feel i want to tear each one down and hammer it over the head of the man who put it up until i have killed him and then i would bury him and put the board up over the grave as a tombstone i mentioned these feelings of mine to harris and he said he had them worse than that he said he not only felt he wanted to kill the man who caused the board to be put up but that he should like to slaughter the whole of his family and all his friends and relations and then burn down his house this seemed to me to be going too far and i said so to harris but

this bulk seemed to me heave to be going fogo
12
far grog and willy i said mobs so glyph duns harris but
1986
he answered not a bit of it serve em all jolly well right and i d go and sing comic songs on the ruins i was vexed to hear harris go on in this blood thirsty strain we never ought to allow our instincts of justice to degenerate into mere vindictiveness it was a long while before i could get harris to take a more christian view of the subject but i succeeded at last and he promised me that he would spare the friends and relations at all events and would not sing comic songs on the ruins you have never heard harris sing a comic song or you would understand the service i had rendered to mankind it is one of harris s fixed ideas that he can sing a comic song the fixed idea on the contrary among those of harris s friends who have heard him try is that he can t and never will be able to and that he ought not to be allowed to try when harris is at a party and is asked to sing he replies well i can only sing a comic song you know and he says it in a tone that implies that his singing of that however is a thing that you ought to hear once and then die oh that is nice says the hostess do sing one mr harris and harris gets up and makes for the piano with the beaming cheeriness of a generous minded man who is just about to give somebody something now silence please everybody says the hostess turning round mr harris is going to sing a comic song oh how jolly they murmur and they hurry in from the conservatory and come up from the stairs and go and fetch each other from all over the house and crowd into the drawing room and sit round all smirking in anticipation then harris begins well you don t look for much of a voice in a comic song you don t expect correct phrasing or vocalization you don t mind if a man does find out when in the middle of a note that he is too high and comes down with a jerk you don t bother about time you don t mind a man being two bars in front of the accompaniment and easing up in the middle of a line to argue it out with the pianist and then starting the verse afresh but you do expect the words you don t expect a man to never remember more than the first three lines of the first verse and to keep on repeating these until it is time to begin the chorus you don t expect a man to break off in the middle of a line and snigger and say it s very funny but he s blest if he can think of the rest of it and then try and make it up for himself and afterwards suddenly recollect it when he has got to an entirely different part of the song and break off without a word of warning to go back and let you have it then and there you don t well i will just give you an idea of harris s comic singing and then you can judge of it for yourself harrisharris standing up in front of piano and addressing the expectant mob i m afraid it s a very old thing you know i expect you all know it you know but it s the only thing i know it s the judge s song out of pinafore no i don t mean pinafore i mean you know what i mean the other thing you know you must all join in the chorus you know murmurs of delight and anxiety to join in the chorus brilliant performance of prelude to the judge s song in trial by jury by nervous pianist moment arrives for harris to join in harris takes no notice of it nervous pianist commences prelude over again and harris commencing singing at the same time dashes off the first two lines of the first lord s song out of pinafore nervous pianist tries to push on with prelude gives it up and tries to follow harris with accompaniment to judge s song out of trial by jury finds that doesn t answer and tries to recollect what he is doing and where he is feels his mind giving way and stops short harris with kindly encouragement it s all right you re doing it very well indeed go on nervous pianist i m afraid there s a mistake somewhere what are you singing harris promptly why the judge s song out of trial by jury don t you know it some friend of harris s from the back of the room no you re not you chuckle head you re singing the admiral s song from pinafore long argument between harris and harris s friend as to what harris is really singing friend finally suggests that it doesn t matter what harris is singing so long as harris gets on and sings it and harris with an evident sense of injustice rankling inside him requests pianist to begin again pianist thereupon starts prelude to the admiral s song and harris seizing what he considers to be a favourable opening in the music begins harris when i was young and called to the bar general roar of laughter taken by harris as a compliment pianist thinking of his wife and family gives up the unequal contest and retires his place being taken by a stronger nerved man the new pianist cheerily now then old man you start off and i ll follow we won t bother about any prelude harris upon whom the explanation of matters has slowly dawned laughing by jove i beg your pardon of course i ve been mixing up the two songs it was jenkins confused me you know now then singing his voice appearing to come from the cellar and suggesting the first low warnings of an approaching earthquake when i was young i served a term as office boy to an attorney s firm aside to pianist it is too low old man we ll have that over again if you don t mind sings first two lines over again in a high falsetto this time great surprise on the part of the audience nervous old lady near the fire begins to cry and has to be led out harris continuing i swept the windows and i swept the door and i no no i cleaned the windows of the big front door and i polished up the floor no dash it i beg your pardon funny thing i can t think of that line and i and i oh well we ll get on to the chorus and chance it sings and i diddle diddle diddle diddle diddle diddle de till now i am the ruler of the queen s navee now then chorus it is the last two lines repeated you know general chorus and he diddle diddle diddle diddle diddle diddle dee d till now he is the ruler of the queen s navee and harris never sees what an ass he is making of himself and how he is annoying a lot of people who never did him any harm he honestly imagines that he has given them a treat and says he will sing another comic song after supper speaking of comic songs and parties reminds me of a rather curious incident at which i once assisted which as it throws much light upon the inner mental working of human nature in general ought i think to be recorded in these pages we were a fashionable and highly cultured party we had on our best clothes and we talked pretty and were very happy all except two young fellows students just returned from germany commonplace young men who seemed restless and uncomfortable as if they found the proceedings slow the truth was we were too clever for them our brilliant but polished conversation and our high class tastes were beyond them they were out of place among us they never ought to have been there at all everybody agreed upon that later on we played morceaux from the old german masters we discussed philosophy and ethics we flirted with graceful dignity we were even humorous in a high class way somebody recited a french poem after supper and we said it was beautiful and then a lady sang a sentimental ballad in spanish and it made one or two of us weep it was so pathetic and then those two young men got up and asked us if we had ever heard herr slossenn boschen who had just arrived and was then down in the supper room sing his great german comic song none of us had heard it that we could remember the young men said it was the funniest song that had ever been written and that if we liked they would get herr slossenn boschen whom they knew very well to sing it they said it was so funny that when herr slossenn boschen had sung it once before the german emperor he the german emperor had had to be carried off to bed they said nobody could sing it like herr slossenn boschen he was so intensely serious all through it that you might fancy he was reciting a tragedy and that of course made it all the funnier they said he never once suggested by his tone or manner that he was singing anything funny that would spoil it it was his air of seriousness almost of pathos that made it so irresistibly amusing we said we yearned to hear it that we wanted a good laugh and they went downstairs and fetched herr slossenn boschen he appeared to be quite pleased to sing it for he came up at once and sat down to the piano without another word oh it will amuse you you will laugh whispered the two young men as they passed through the room and took up an unobtrusive position behind the professor s back herr slossenn boschen accompanied himself the prelude did not suggest a comic song exactly it was a weird soulful air it quite made one s flesh creep but we murmured to one another that it was the german method and prepared to enjoy it i don t understand german myself i learned it at school but forgot every word of it two years after i had left and have felt much better ever since still i did not want the people there to guess my ignorance so i hit upon what i thought to be rather a good idea i kept my eye on the two young students and followed them when they tittered i tittered when they roared i roared and i also threw in a little snigger all by myself now and then as if i had seen a bit of humour that had escaped the others i considered this particularly artful on my part i noticed as the song progressed that a good many other people seemed to have their eye fixed on the two young men as well as myself these other people also tittered when the young men tittered and roared when the young men roared and as the two young men tittered and roared and exploded with laughter pretty continuously all through the song it went exceedingly well and yet that german professor did not seem happy at first when we began to laugh the expression of his face was one of intense surprise as if laughter were the very last thing he had expected to be greeted with we thought this

very funny we said his earnest manner was half the humour the slightest hint on his part that he knew how funny he was would have completely ruined it all as we continued to laugh his surprise gave way to an air of annoyance and indignation and he scowled fiercely round upon us all except upon the two young men who being behind him he could not see that sent us into convulsions we told each other that it would be the death of us this thing the words alone we said were enough to send us into fits but added to his mock seriousness oh it was too much in the last verse he surpassed himself he glowered round upon us with a look of such concentrated ferocity that but for our being forewarned as to the german method of comic singing we should have been nervous and he threw such a wailing note of agony into the weird music that if we had not known it was a funny song we might have wept he finished amid a perfect shriek of laughter we said it was the funniest thing we had ever heard in all our lives we said how strange it was that in the face of things like these there should be a popular notion that the germans hadn t any sense of humour and we asked the professor why he didn t translate the song into english so that the common people could understand it and hear what a real comic song was like then herr slossenn boschen got up and went on awful he swore at us in german which i should judge to be a singularly effective language for that purpose and he danced and shook his fists and called us all the english he knew he said he had never been so insulted in all his life it appeared that the song was not a comic song at all it was about a young girl who lived in the hartz mountains and who had given up her life to save her lover s soul and he died and met her spirit in the air and then in the last verse he jilted her spirit and went on with another spirit i m not quite sure of the details but it was something very sad i know herr boschen said he had sung it once before the german emperor and he the german emperor had sobbed like a little child he herr boschen said it was generally acknowledged to be one of the most tragic and pathetic songs in the german language it was a trying situation for us very trying there seemed to be no answer we looked around for the two young men who had done this thing but they had left the house in an unostentatious manner immediately after the end of the song that was the end of that party i never saw a party break up so quietly and with so little fuss we never said good night even to one another we came downstairs one at a time walking softly and keeping the shady side we asked the servant for our hats and coats in whispers and opened the door for ourselves and slipped out and got round the corner quickly avoiding each other as much as possible i have never taken much interest in german songs since then we reached sunbury lock at half past three the river is sweetly pretty just there before you come to the gates and the backwater is charming but don t attempt to row up it i tried to do so once i was sculling and asked the fellows who were steering if they thought it could be done and they said oh yes they thought so if i pulled hard we were just under the little foot bridge that crosses it between the two weirs when they said this and i bent down over the sculls and set myself up and pulled i pulled splendidly i got well into a steady rhythmical swing i put my arms and my legs and my back into it i set myself a good quick dashing stroke and worked in really grand style my two friends said it was a pleasure to watch me at the end of five minutes i thought we ought to be pretty near the weir and i looked up we were under the bridge in exactly the same spot that we were when i began and there were those two idiots injuring themselves by violent laughing i had been grinding away like mad to keep that boat stuck still under that bridge i let other people pull up backwaters against strong streams now we sculled up to walton a rather large place for a riverside town as with all riverside places only the tiniest corner of it comes down to the water so that from the boat you might fancy it was a village of some half dozen houses all told windsor and abingdon are the only towns between london and oxford that you can really see anything of from the stream all the others hide round corners and merely peep at the river down one street my thanks to them for being so considerate and leaving the river banks to woods and fields and water works even reading though it does its best to spoil and sully and make hideous as much of the river as it can reach is good natured enough to keep its ugly face a good deal out of sight c sar of course had a little place at walton a camp or an entrenchment or something of that sort c sar was a regular up river man also queen elizabeth she was there too you can never get away from that woman go where you will cromwell and bradshaw not the guide man but the king charles s head man likewise sojourned here they must have been quite a pleasant little party altogether there is an iron scold s bridle in walton church they used these things in ancient days for curbing women s tongues they have given up the attempt now i suppose iron was getting scarce and nothing else would be strong enough there are also tombs of note in the church and i was afraid i should never get harris past them but he didn t seem to think of them and we went on above the bridge the river winds tremendously this makes it look picturesque but it irritates you from a towing or sculling point of view and causes argument between the man who is pulling and the man who is steering you pass oatlands park on the right bank here it is a famous old place henry viii stole it from some one or the other i forget whom now and lived in it there is a grotto in the park which you can see for a fee and which is supposed to be very wonderful but i cannot see much in it myself the late duchess of york who lived at oatlands was very fond of dogs and kept an immense number she had a special graveyard made in which to bury them when they died and there they lie about fifty of them with a tombstone over each and an epitaph inscribed thereon well i dare say they deserve it quite as much as the average christian does at corway stakes the first bend above walton bridge was fought a battle between c sar and cassivelaunus cassivelaunus had prepared the river for c sar by planting it full of stakes and had no doubt put up a notice board but c sar crossed in spite of this you couldn t choke c sar off that river he is the sort of man we want round the backwaters now halliford and shepperton are both pretty little spots where they touch the river but there is nothing remarkable about either of them there is a tomb in shepperton churchyard however with a poem on it and i was nervous lest harris should want to get out and fool round it i saw him fix a longing eye on the landing stage as we drew near it so i managed by an adroit movement to jerk his cap into the water and in the excitement of recovering that and his indignation at my clumsiness he forgot all about his beloved graves at weybridge the wey a pretty little stream navigable for small boats up to guildford and one which i have always been making up my mind to explore and never have the bourne and the basingstoke canal all enter the thames together the lock is just opposite the town and the first thing that we saw when we came in view of it was george s blazer on one of the lock gates closer inspection showing that george was inside it montmorency set up a furious barking i shrieked harris roared george waved his hat and yelled back the lock keeper rushed out with a drag under the impression that somebody had fallen into the lock and appeared annoyed at finding that no one had george had rather a curious oilskin covered parcel in his hand it was round and flat at one end with a long straight handle sticking out of it what s that said harris a frying pan no said george with a strange wild look glittering in his eyes they are all the rage this season everybody has got them up the river it s a banjo i never knew you played the banjo cried harris and i in one breath not exactly replied george but it s very easy they tell me and i ve got the instruction book george and the banjo chapter ix george is introduced to work heathenish instincts of tow lines ungrateful conduct of a double sculling skiff towers and towed a use discovered for lovers strange disappearance of an elderly lady much haste less speed being towed by girls exciting sensation the missing lock or the haunted river music saved we made george work now we had got him he did not want to work of course that goes without saying he had had a hard time in the city so he explained harris who is callous in his nature and not prone to pity said ah and now you are going to have a hard time on the river for a change change is good for everyone out you get he could not in conscience not even george s conscience object though he did suggest that perhaps it would be better for him to stop in the boat and get tea ready while harris and i towed because getting tea was such a worrying work and harris and i looked tired the only reply we made to this however was to pass him over the tow line and he took it and stepped out dog wrapped in tow linethere is something very strange and unaccountable about a tow line you roll it up with as much patience and care as you would take to fold up a new pair of trousers and five minutes afterwards when you pick it up it is one ghastly soul revolting tangle i do not wish to be insulting but i firmly believe that if you took an average tow line and stretched it out straight across the middle of a field and then turned your back on it for thirty seconds that when you looked round again you would find that it had got itself altogether in a heap in the middle of the field and had twisted itself up and tied
